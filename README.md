# Cipher-Collection

This library consists of implementations of four different ciphers. 

All the code is written in Scala 3; the exercises are taken from the Cryptography and Online Security course that I am currently taking. 

---

To test the code, just run the *Main* class inside the project, or simply copy any of the code from the different classes. 

I'm kind of a newbie in Scala, so any recommendations on how to improve the structure or code inside the project, enhance any function or simply any advice you may have, I'll take it with all the love in the world ❤️.
